This Graffiti app was created for a MintBean Hackathon!

## About the Developer
Before attending Hackbright Academy, LaRena spent most of her adult life clowning around in the circus (yes, you read that right).  She studied Theatre in college and then honed her circus and clowning skills at the San Francisco Clown Conservatory.  LaRena spent 8 years touring full time in the US, Mexico and Japan with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey as well as Kinoshita Circus. Despite her passion for travel, being on the road 52 weeks a year can wear out even the most seasoned traveller.  Looking to live in one place and ready for the next step in her career, coupled with massive amounts of time in the current pandemic, LaRena discovered a love for software development and has enjoyed putting her previously unused math and logic skills to good use and learning to code.

On this simple graffiti app the user can:
* Select from a variety of brick wall backgrounds
* Resize their canvas
* Select from a variety of colors and brush sizes
* Trash their image
* Save their image to their computer

## <a name="future"></a>The Future of LaRena's Graffiti Wall
I have lots of ideas for an additional sprint including:
* add shading to the paint feature so that the longer you paint the darker the color gets.
* Customized color picker
* Better CSS styling!
